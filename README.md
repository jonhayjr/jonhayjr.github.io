# Jon Hay's Portfolio Site - MERN Stack

I originally created this portfolio site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This was the final project for Team Treehouse's Front End Web Development Techdegree program.  You can find the original project [`here`](https://github.com/jonhayjr/Treehouse-FEWD-Project9).  After completing the Full JavaScript Techdegree program with Team Treehouse, I decided to rebuild this project using the MERN stack.  I used a serverless backend for the API on MongoDB Realm.  You can find the original backend code [`here`](https://github.com/jonhayjr/react-portfolio-mern) in the `api` folder.  You can click [`here`](https://www.jonhayjr.com) for a live preview.
